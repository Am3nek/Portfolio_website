            <h3>Smart Attendence System</h3>
            <p>About the project:<br>
                SMART ATTENDENCE SYSTEM
                This is a system which works with RFID and face recognition. In this
                project with the help of ESP32, RC522 (RFID Scanner) and ESP32
                camera module me and my team created an attendance system
                where a person scans their face and scans their RFID tag one after
                the other then only the attendance will be provided. And to check
                the attendence I created a backend server using Django and frontend
                which was used to verify that the attendence for that day is provided
                or not.</p>

            <h3>Python Snake Game</h3>
            <p>About the project:<br>
                This is a snake game that I made with python using Turtle library. This
                is a very beginner level project. In this the snake moves throughout
                the screen and if it eats food then the length of the snake increases.
                And if it hits itself or the wall then it dies.</p>
